[Verse 1]
After the party and people all fade
That's when I miss you the most
Try to forget you, but can't find the way
Guess that's just life, I suppose

[Pre-Chorus]
But I miss you when you're gone
And I know that life moves on
But I can't just replace you with this much regret
Please, don't forget about me

[Chorus]
Just yet, don't forget me
Don't forget me
Just yet, don't forget me
Don't forget me

[Verse 2]
Remember when all that we had was your car?
Counting our quarters each night
Every day wanderin' towards our North Star
Guess we got lost in the light

[Pre-Chorus]
But I miss you when you're gone
So I wrote you one last song
But I can't just replace you with this much regret
Please, don't forget about me

[Chorus]
Just yet, don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (-get me)
Don't forget me
Just yet, don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (Promise me)
Don't forget me

[Post-Chorus]
Just yet
Even when it's gone
Can we just hold on?

[Bridge]
After the years and the thousands of tears
Say it 'til nothin' is left
I won't forget you
I won't forget you

[Chorus]
So don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (-get me)
Don't forget me (Don't forget)
Don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (Promise me)
Don't forget me
(Just yet) Askin' you (Don't for-), beggin' you (-get me)
Promise me, ooh (Don't forget me)
(Just yet) Askin' you (Don't for-), beggin' you (-get me)
Promise me, ooh (Don't forget me)

[Outro]
Just yet
Just yet
