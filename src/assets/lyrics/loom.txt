[Verse 1]
I'm standing in the shadows
Watching as the world goes by
I'm waiting for the moment
When I can finally fly

[Chorus]
Loom, loom, loom
The future's coming soon
Loom, loom, loom
I'll be there with you

[Verse 2]
The past is just a memory
The present's slipping by
The future's just a mystery
But I'm not afraid to try

[Chorus]
Loom, loom, loom
The future's coming soon
Loom, loom, loom
I'll be there with you

[Bridge]
Through the darkness and the light
We'll find our way
Through the chaos and the fight
We'll make it through the day

[Chorus]
Loom, loom, loom
The future's coming soon
Loom, loom, loom
I'll be there with you
