[Verse 1]
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind

[Chorus]
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-

[Verse 2]
Not a yes sir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder

[Chorus]
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-

[Bridge]
Kids were laughing in my classes
While I was scheming for the masses
Who do you think you are?
Dreaming 'bout being a big star

[Chorus]
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
