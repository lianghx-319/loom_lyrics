[Verse 1]
I'm standing in the fire
Watching as the flames grow higher
I'm waiting for the moment
When I can finally rise

[Chorus]
Fire in these hills
Burning bright and strong
Fire in these hills
We'll carry on

[Verse 2]
The past is just a memory
The present's slipping by
The future's just a mystery
But I'm not afraid to try

[Chorus]
Fire in these hills
Burning bright and strong
Fire in these hills
We'll carry on

[Bridge]
Through the darkness and the light
We'll find our way
Through the chaos and the fight
We'll make it through the day

[Chorus]
Fire in these hills
Burning bright and strong
Fire in these hills
We'll carry on
