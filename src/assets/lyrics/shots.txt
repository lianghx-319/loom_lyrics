[Introduction to Smoke + Mirrors]

[Intro]
I'm sorry for everything
Oh, everything I've done

[Verse 1]
Am I out of touch? Am I out of my place
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space?
Oh, I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

[Refrain]
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck over and over and over again

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for everything
Oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved

[Verse 2]
Am I out of luck? Am I waiting to break
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape?
Oh, I'm wishin' I had what I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong

[Refrain]
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck over and over and over again

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for everything
Oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved

[Bridge]
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away

[Chorus]
I'm sorry for everything
Oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole (Oh, let me make it up to you)
Through every single thing that I loved (Let me make it up to you)

[Outro]
In the meantime, we let it go
At the roadside we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away
At the bay side, where you used to show
In the moonlight, where we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh, we let this drift away (Let me make it up to you)
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh, there's always time to change your mind
Oh, love, can you hear me?
Oh, let it drift away
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
