[Verse 1]
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I'm dreaming of you
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I'm dreaming of you

[Chorus]
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I'm dreaming of you
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I'm dreaming of you

[Verse 2]
The past is just a memory
The present's slipping by
The future's just a mystery
But I'm not afraid to try

[Chorus]
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I'm dreaming of you
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I'm dreaming of you

[Bridge]
Through the darkness and the light
We'll find our way
Through the chaos and the fight
We'll make it through the day

[Chorus]
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I'm dreaming of you
Eyes closed, eyes closed
I'm dreaming of you
