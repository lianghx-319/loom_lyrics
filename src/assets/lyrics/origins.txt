[Verse 1]
Back to where it all began
To the roots of who we are
Through the fire and the flame
We'll find our way again

[Chorus]
Origins, origins
Where it all begins
Origins, origins
Let the story spin

[Verse 2]
The past is calling, can you hear it?
The future's waiting, can you feel it?
Together we'll make it through
Back to where it all began

[Chorus]
Origins, origins
Where it all begins
Origins, origins
Let the story spin

[Bridge]
Through the darkness and the light
We'll find our way
Through the chaos and the fight
We'll make it through the day

[Chorus]
Origins, origins
Where it all begins
Origins, origins
Let the story spin
