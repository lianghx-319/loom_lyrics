[Verse 1]
I'm sorry for everything
Oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved

[Chorus]
Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh, I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

[Verse 2]
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm always doing this

[Chorus]
Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh, I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong

[Bridge]
I'm sorry for everything
Oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born
It seems I had a loaded gun

[Chorus]
Am I out of touch?
Am I out of my place?
When I keep saying that I'm looking for an empty space
Oh, I'm wishing you're here
But I'm wishing you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
