[Verse 1]
Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think
I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a thousand million lives

[Chorus]
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

[Verse 2]
I-I-I got this feeling, yeah, you know
Where I'm losing all control
'Cause there's magic in my bones
I-I-I got this feeling in my soul
Go ahead and throw your stones
'Cause there's magic in my bones

[Chorus]
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning
Is this entertaining?

[Bridge]
Playing with a stick of dynamite
There was never gray in black and white
There was never wrong 'til there was right
Oh, playing with a stick of dynamite

[Chorus]
My patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
Our patience is waning
Is this entertaining?
