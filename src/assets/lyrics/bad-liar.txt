[Verse 1]
Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don't prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darling, trust me darling
It's been a loveless year
I'm a man of three fears
Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
Trust me, darling, trust me, darling

[Chorus]
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe

[Verse 2]
But I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, now you know
I'm a bad liar, bad liar
Now you know, you're free to go

[Chorus]
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe

[Bridge]
Did all my dreams never mean one thing?
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring?
Oh, I've been asking for
Oh, I've been asking for problems, problems, problems

[Chorus]
So look me in the eyes
Tell me what you see
Perfect paradise
Tearing at the seams
I wish I could escape
I don't wanna fake it
Wish I could erase it
Make your heart believe
