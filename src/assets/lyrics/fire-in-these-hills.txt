[Intro]
I don't think that I'm strong enough
I don't think that I'm enough

[Verse 1]
And I know you think about everything that I did wrong, but I do, too
Stayin' up these nights, drinkin' everything, I got nothing without you
I fear I might die alone
I fear I might knock and no one's home
Stayin' up these nights, thinkin' everything that I did wrong to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think that I'm strong enough
I'm never enough

[Chorus]
'Cause there's fire in these hills
And I think I've lost the will
The more we try, the more we fail
But after everything, you're here with mе still
'Cause there's firе in these hills
And I think I've lost my will
The more we try, the more we fail
But after everything, you're here with me still

[Verse 2]
Gonna turn this car around, open up a sit-down, tell you all the truth
Gonna fade myself out, talkin' myself down, lightin' up this fuse
I fear I might wreck this home
I fear I might knock and no one comes
And I know you think about everything that I did wrong, but I do, too

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think that I'm strong enough

[Chorus]
'Cause there's fire in these hills
And I think I've lost my will
The more we try, the more we fail
But after everything, you're here with me still
'Cause there's fire in these hills
And I think I've lost my will
The more we try, the more we fail
But after everything, you're here with me still

[Post-Chorus]
(The more we try, the—)
(I don't think that I'm enough)

[Bridge]
I'm so tired, can I please come home?
I've run so far, can I, can I come home?
I'm so tired, can I please come home?
I've run so far, can I, can I come home?
I'm so tired, can I please come home?
I've run so far, can I, can I come home?

[Outro]
I'm so tired, can I please?
