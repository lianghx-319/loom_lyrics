[Verse 1]
Change is coming, can you feel it?
The world is turning, can you see it?
We're evolving, can you hear it?
The future's calling, can you meet it?

[Chorus]
Evolve, evolve, we're changing
Evolve, evolve, rearranging
Evolve, evolve, we're growing
Evolve, evolve, keep going

[Verse 2]
The past is gone, it's in the rearview
The present's here, it's what we're living through
The future's bright, it's what we're moving to
Together we'll make it through

[Chorus]
Evolve, evolve, we're changing
Evolve, evolve, rearranging
Evolve, evolve, we're growing
Evolve, evolve, keep going

[Bridge]
Through the fire and the rain
We'll find our way again
Through the joy and the pain
We'll make it through the change

[Chorus]
Evolve, evolve, we're changing
Evolve, evolve, rearranging
Evolve, evolve, we're growing
Evolve, evolve, keep going
